Artists have been interested in translating visual information to sound and vica versa.   
Does science do anything like this?   
Why do we (they) do this?

## visual music

According to Wikipedia, **visual music** can mean many things:

- the use of musical structures in visual imagery;
- methods or devices which can translate sounds or music into a related visual presentation;
- systems converting sound to visual forms (film, graphics, installations, performances);
- translation of music to painting;
- form of [intermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermedia);

and the definition is constantly expending. I like intermedia the most, where the information to be translated can originate from both. Well, and perhaps information can go in both direction, feeding each other. Think about how programming and sensors in a live performance could help!

Also, have you heard of the terms   
_inter-disciplinary_,   
_cross-disciplinary_ and    
_multi-disciplinary_?

## synaeshesia

According to Wikipedia, **synaesthesia**

> is a perceptual phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.

In this video [Jamie Ward](http://gocognitive.net/interviews/jamie-ward-synesthesia) explains further:

## Visual Music Examples

### The Twittering Machine
of Paul Klee

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Die_Zwitscher-Maschine_%28Twittering_Machine%29.jpg)

musical interpretation 1 by Gunther Schuller [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD6m-qK6lWk).

musical interpretation 2 by Cindy McTee [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knYZvRssrCM).

Gunter and Cindy are the composers who interpret the visuals. Then this composition is further refined by the conductor and the instrument players and then finally by the listener. We all add nuances to the what we are given as information. Isn't this a bit like gossiping?

### Dance of Light

musical interpretations by ARU M4MI cohort (2017) [here](http://rq-lightart.com/m4mi-anglia-ruskin-university/).
