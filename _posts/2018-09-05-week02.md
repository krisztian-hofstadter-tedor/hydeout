> My Life;-   
> How much more of it remains?   
> The night is brief.    

---

> Smoothed by seas   
> A nearly round rock   
> Points homeward  


---


> Tremble, oh my gravemound,   
> in time my cries will be   
> only this autumn wind   


---


> Nude Beach   
> Nothing New   
> Under The Sun   


---

> The Depths, Swelling Green   
> Leviathan Walks, Waves Break   
> Cold Sleet, it is here. 

---

> The wind of war   
> Blowing across my face   
> The thunder roaring loudly   

---


> An SSBN   
> Moves silently through the deep -   
> Five knots to nowhere.

* So what is an imaginary soundscape? How can we compose one? Let's the [terminology](http://m4mi.tedor.info/resources/terminology) page.  

* Read the poems, choose one.
* Close your eyes and imagine the happenings, pictures, movements. There might be animals, humans, machines, nature, synthetic sounds, abstract sounds, conversations, real environments... Hear their sound. 
* Capture the emotional content, rhythm, pace, form. 
* Use a pen and paper, draw a picture or a map. Imagine moving inside your new world, listen. 
* Think about the relationship of your objects, compare them to each other, find differences and similarities in the way they look, feel, sound. 
* Make sound recordings of voice, traditional instruments, synthesise sounds, use sound libraries** as well as DSP (Digital Signal Processing) e.g. filtering, panning, reverb, delay... to create a palette of objects, the sound, the building blocks. 
* Analyse the waveform of a poems sound recording. There might be a picture in there:

* Organise these objects into a composition so that it has a flow, where the listener can immerse in a journey inside your Imaginary Soundscape. In other words, create a narrative, a story. 
* Use detailed musical expressions, nuances, to guide the listener. Incorporate music theory if you'd like. 
* Think about space, acoustics, the movement of the listener vs. movement of listener's focus. What is the difference?

Any other ideas?
