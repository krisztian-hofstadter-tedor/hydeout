![Sound in Games](http://tedor.info/extra/M4MI/M4MI-game%20audio-wallup-9628.jpg)

*Why make audio for games?*

* saturated music industry
* can be another income source besides
performing, composing for films/games, making audio libraries, sound recording at shows, music teacher...
* the game industry is larger than the film industry - More jobs?  

*What does audio in films and games do?*

- sets the mood/emotion;
- identifies time/place;
- identifies character (leitmotif);
- sets pace;
- increases immersion;
- character subtext;
- ...

What's the difference in audio for films and games?

## Film vs Game Music

![Non linear](https://heterogenoustasks.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/openmap.png)

* linear vs non-linear (excl. trailers)
* carefully crafter music loops
* interactivity: sounds are triggered, mapped


## Different Categories

![Some games](http://blu-phhs-school.doomby.com/medias/images/addicting-games-1.jpg)

* online games, console, mobile games
* action-adventure, strategy, RPG,
* casual vs serious i.e educational
* multiplayer vs singleplayer
* ?

Playing games makes you aware of the audio conventions to follow, or break. Now you have an excuse to play computer games :)

## Be Organised

(Even more than when working on film.)

![Be organised](http://www.tedor.info/extra/M4MI/M4MI%20-%20be%20organised.jpg)

* Name your audio files descriptively in organised folders.
* Ask your client for 'file naming conventions'.

## Your Job

* specialised audio job e.g. composing (often AAA) vs everything from foley to mastering (often indie game)
* in-house (often AAA) vs freelance/contract.

AAA chain:   
1) game designer > 2) game developer/producer > 3) audio lead/director > 4) composer, sound designer, [audio programmer](http://www.jobsite.co.uk/vacancies?search_type=quick&query=audio+programmer&location=&radius=50).

*Suggestion:*    
Concentrate on what you want to do, but if you are comfortable with technology learn how to code, record, mix, master, ...

* [Mono] [Stereo] [Surround] [Binaural]   
*What is the difference?*

* [Immersive](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/immersive) - how does our audio help immersion?

Get to know different systems - will add to your skillset!

**Binaural Game Example:**

Use headphones with the video to fully *immerse* in it.

### History and Examples of Game Audio

![First game](http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cbffcefde9250a6c40fc92/master/w_790,c_limit/image.jpg)
Evolution of audio in games: Silent games > sine and square waves on hardware chips > FM synthesis > MIDI > 8 bit [PCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation) > 16 bit PCM.

### Project Management

![Trello](https://d2k1ftgv7pobq7.cloudfront.net/meta/p/res/images/fb4de993e22034b76539da073ea8d35c/home-hero.png)

When you work with game developers you might be asked to join a web-based project management application like [Trello](https://trello.com/b/HUadsBaL/storm-brothers) or [Mantis Bug Tracker](http://www.i-show-you.de/mantis/my_view_page.php).

Benefits of using a PM:

* simple to assign tasks to members
* keeps a project on schedule with deadlines and the visual narrative
* communication in the task environment

**The Role of Audio for Immersion in Games**   
"Immersion is considered to be one of the key factors making games worthy to play. The unity that seems to exist in the fact that many parties value this phenomenon is more apparent than real: there is a lot of dispute on the scope of immersion. Several classifications of immersion are compared for a better understanding of the nature of an immersive experience. The three‐dimensional SCI‐model by Ermi & Mäyrä (2005) is considered as valuable representation of the multi‐dimensional character of immersion."

> Everybody loves to play this game — the game of hide-and-seek, the game of scaring oneself with uncertainty. It is human. It is why we go to the theater or movies and why we read novels. And our so-called real life, seen from the position of the mystic, is a version of the same thing. The mystic is the person who has realized that the game is a game. It is hide-and-seek, and everything associated with the “hide” side of it is connected to those places within us where we as individuals feel lonely, impotent, put down, and so on — the negative side of existence. ~ Alan Watts
