## Assignment Criteria
Your work will be marked according to the criteria set out in the Artefact Creation document. It will be marked by me and moderated by another staff in the music department. Selected submissions will also be examined by external examiners from other universities.


### Most important advice
The assignments should be considered as your own projects, not something you have to do for me or the university. Follow the rules outlined in this module guide, assessment criteria, etc., however, please keep in mind that the outcomes of your assignments can (and should) become part of your professional portfolios, which you later can use for networking, job hunting, etc.
